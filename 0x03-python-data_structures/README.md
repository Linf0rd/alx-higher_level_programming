## Tasks

### 0. Print a list of integers

🔢 Task: Write a function in Python that prints all integers of a list.

### 1. Secure access to an element in a list

🔒 Task: Write a function in Python that retrieves an element from a list like in C.

### 2. Replace element

🔄 Task: Write a function in Python that replaces an element of a list at a specific position.

### 3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!

🔄 Task: Write a function in Python that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

### 4. Replace in a copy

📑 Task: Write a function in Python that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

### 5. Can you C me now?

🔡 Task: Write a function in Python that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.

### 6. Lists of lists = Matrix

🔢 Task: Write a function in Python that prints a matrix of integers.

### 7. Tuples addition

➕ Task: Write a function in Python that adds 2 tuples.

### 8. More returns!

🔙 Task: Write a function in Python that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

### 9. Find the max

🔢 Task: Write a function in Python that finds the biggest integer of a list.

### 10. Only by 2

✖️ Task: Write a function in Python that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.

### 11. Delete at

❌ Task: Write a function in Python that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.

### 12. Switch

🔀 Task: Write a function in Python that switches the values of two variables.

### 13. Linked list palindrome

🔗 Task: Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

### 14. CPython #0: Python lists

📜 Task: Create a C function that prints some basic info about Python lists.
