## Tasks

### 0. Squared simple

🔢 Task: Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.

### 1. Search and replace

🔄 Task: Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.

### 2. Unique addition

➕ Task: Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).

### 3. Present in both

🔗 Task: Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.

### 4. Only differents

🔄 Task: Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.

### 5. Number of keys

🔢 Task: Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.

### 6. Print sorted dictionary

📑 Task: Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.

### 7. Update dictionary

🔄 Task: Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.

### 8. Simple delete by key

❌ Task: Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.

### 9. Multiply by 2

✖️ Task: Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.

### 10. Best score

🔢 Task: Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.

### 11. Multiply by using map

🔢 Task: Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.

### 12. Roman to Integer

🔢 Task: Create a function `def roman_to_int(roman_string):` that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.

### 13. Weighted average!

🔢 Task: Write a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple `(<score>, <weight>)`.

### 14. Squared by using map

🔢 Task: Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using `map`.

### 15. Delete by value

❌ Task: Write a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.

### 16. CPython #1: PyBytesObject

🔢 Task: Create two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects.
