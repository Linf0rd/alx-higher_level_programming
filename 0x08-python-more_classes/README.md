## Tasks

### 0. Simple rectangle

📏 Task: Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

### 1. Real definition of a rectangle

📏 Task: Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by its width and height.

### 2. Area and Perimeter

📐 Task: Write a class `Rectangle` that calculates the area and perimeter of the rectangle.

### 3. String representation

🔤 Task: Write a class `Rectangle` that provides a string representation of the rectangle.

### 4. Eval is magic

🪄 Task: Write a class `Rectangle` that provides an `eval()` representation.

### 5. Detect instance deletion

🚨 Task: Write a class `Rectangle` that prints a message when an instance is deleted.

### 6. How many instances

🔢 Task: Write a class `Rectangle` that keeps track of the number of instances created.

### 7. Change representation

🔤 Task: Write a class `Rectangle` that allows changing the symbol used for string representation.

### 8. Compare rectangles

🔢 Task: Write a class `Rectangle` that compares two rectangles by their area.

### 9. A square is a rectangle

📏 Task: Write a class `Rectangle` that can be used to create a square.
