## Tasks

### 0. Read file

📄 Task: Write a function that reads a text file (UTF8) and prints it to stdout.

### 1. Write to a file

📝 Task: Write a function that writes a string to a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters written.

### 2. Append to a file

➕ Task: Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added.

### 3. To JSON string

🔄 Task: Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string).

### 4. From JSON string to Object

🔄 Task: Write a function that returns an object (Python data structure) represented by a JSON string.

### 5. Save Object to a file

💾 Task: Write a function that writes an Object to a text file, using a JSON representation.

### 6. Create object from a JSON file

📂 Task: Write a function that creates an Object from a “JSON file”.

### 7. Load, add, save

🔄 Task: Write a script that adds all arguments to a Python list, and then save them to a file.

### 8. Class to JSON

🔄 Task: Write a function that returns the dictionary description with a simple data structure (list, dictionary, string, integer and boolean) for JSON serialization of an object.

### 9. Student to JSON

🔄 Task: Write a class `Student` that defines a student by `first_name`, `last_name`, and `age`, and has a method to retrieve a dictionary representation.

### 10. Student to JSON with filter

🔄 Task: Write a class `Student` that defines a student by `first_name`, `last_name`, and `age`, and has a method to retrieve a dictionary representation based on attributes.

### 11. Student to disk and reload

🔄 Task: Write a class `Student` that defines a student by `first_name`, `last_name`, and `age`, and has methods to save and reload student data to/from a file.

### 12. Pascal's Triangle

🔺 Task: Write a function that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal’s triangle of `n`.

### 13. Search and update

🔄 Task: Write a function that inserts a line of text to a file, after each line containing a specific string.

### 14. Log parsing

🔄 Task: Write a script that reads `stdin` line by line and computes metrics.
