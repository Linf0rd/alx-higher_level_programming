## Tasks

### 0. Run Python file

üîß Task: Write a Shell script that runs a Python script. The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable `$PYFILE`.

### 1. Run inline

üõ†Ô∏è Task: Write a Shell script that runs Python code. The Python code will be saved in the environment variable `$PYCODE`.

### 2. Hello, print

üëã Task: Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle", followed by a new line.

### 3. Print integer

üî¢ Task: Complete a source code in Python to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by "Battery street", followed by a new line.

### 4. Print float

üíß Task: Complete a source code in Python to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

### 5. Print string

üìù Task: Complete a source code in Python to print a string stored in the variable `str` three times, followed by its first 9 characters.

### 6. Play with strings

üî† Task: Complete a source code in Python to print `Welcome to Holberton School!` by concatenating strings stored in variables.

### 7. Copy - Cut - Paste

‚úÇÔ∏è Task: Complete a source code in Python to copy, cut, and paste parts of a string.

### 8. Create a new sentence

üñãÔ∏è Task: Complete a source code in Python to print `object-oriented programming with Python` followed by a new line.

### 9. Easter Egg

ü•ö Task: Write a Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line.

### 10. Linked list cycle

üîó Task: Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

### 11. Hello, write

üìú Task: Write a Python script that prints exactly "and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19", followed by a new line.

-   Use the function  `write`  from the  `sys`  module
-   You are not allowed to use  `print`
-   Your script should print to  `stderr`
-   Your script should exit with the status code 1

### 12. Compile

‚öôÔ∏è Task: Write a script that compiles a Python script file.

-   The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable  `$PYFILE`
-   The output filename has to be  `$PYFILEc`  (e.g.,  `export PYFILE=my_main.py`  => output filename:  `my_main.pyc`)

### 13. ByteCode -> Python #1

üî¢ Task: Write the Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b):` that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:


 
 
              3 LOAD_CONST		 1 (98)
              3 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              6 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              9 BINARY_POWER
             10 BINARY_ADD
             11 RETURN_VALUE
