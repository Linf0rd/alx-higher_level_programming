## Tasks

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

üî¢ Task: Complete a source code in Python to print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

### 1. The last digit

üî¢ Task: Complete a source code in Python to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

üî† Task: Write a Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

üî† Task: Write a Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, except `q` and `e`, not followed by a new line.

### 4. Hexadecimal printing

üìù Task: Write a Python script that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal.

### 5. 00...99

üî¢ Task: Write a Python script that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need

üìè Task: Write a Python script that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

### 7. islower

üî° Task: Write a function in Python that checks for lowercase characters.

### 8. To uppercase

üî† Task: Write a function in Python that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

### 9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

üî¢ Task: Write a function in Python that prints the last digit of a number.

### 10. a + b

‚ûï Task: Write a function in Python that adds two integers and returns the result.

### 11. a ^ b

‚úñÔ∏è Task: Write a function in Python that computes `a` to the power of `b` and returns the value.

### 12. Fizz Buzz

üî¢ Task: Write a function in Python that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for multiples of five print "Buzz".

### 13. Insert in sorted linked list

üîó Task: Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

### 14. Smile in the mirror

ü™û Task: Write a Python script that prints the ASCII alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase (z in lowercase and Y in uppercase) not followed by a new line.

### 15. Remove at position

üî¢ Task: Write a function in Python that removes a character at the position `n` of a string.

### 16. ByteCode -> Python #2

üî¢ Task: Write the Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b, c):` that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:


```
  3           0 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
              3 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
              6 COMPARE_OP               0 (<)
              9 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       16

  4          12 LOAD_FAST                2 (c)
             15 RETURN_VALUE

  5     >>   16 LOAD_FAST                2 (c)
             19 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
             22 COMPARE_OP               4 (>)
             25 POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE       36

  6          28 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
             31 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
             34 BINARY_ADD
             35 RETURN_VALUE

  7     >>   36 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)
             39 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)
             42 BINARY_MULTIPLY
             43 LOAD_FAST                2 (c)
             46 BINARY_SUBTRACT
             47 RETURN_VALUE
```
